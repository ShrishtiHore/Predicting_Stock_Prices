# Predicting_Stock_Prices
Building a python script to predict stock prices using Scikit-learn library and plotting a graph using Matplotlib.
We create three models for this using SVR(Support Vector Regression) from sklearn(since support vector machine can be used in classification as well a regression).
The three models are linear, polynomial and rbf(radio basis function) and then predict which model gives the best result.
The csv file is downloaded from NASDAQ's website for the last 3 months data.
